## About BIO-Laravel8

BIO-Laravel8 is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. BIO-Laravel8 takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://BIO-Laravel8.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://BIO-Laravel8.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://BIO-Laravel8.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://BIO-Laravel8.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://BIO-Laravel8.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://BIO-Laravel8.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://BIO-Laravel8.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://BIO-Laravel8.com/docs/broadcasting).

BIO-Laravel8 is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
